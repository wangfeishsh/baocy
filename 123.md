**13. Transaction Management**

**13.1 Introduction to Spring Framework transaction management**

Comprehensive transaction support is among the most compelling reasons to use the Spring Framework. The Spring Framework provides a consistent abstraction for transaction management that delivers the following benefits:

* Consistent programming model across different transaction APIs such as Java Transaction API \(JTA\), JDBC, Hibernate, and Java Persistence API \(JPA\).
* Support for declarative transaction management.
* Simpler API for programmatic transaction management than complex transaction APIs such as JTA.
* Excellent integration with Spring’s data access abstractions.

The following sections describe the Spring Framework’s transaction value-adds and technologies. \(The chapter also includes discussions of best practices, application server integration, and solutions to common problems.\)

* Advantages of the Spring Framework’s transaction support model describes _why_ you would use the Spring Framework’s transaction abstraction instead of EJB Container-Managed Transactions \(CMT\) or choosing to drive local transactions through a proprietary API such as Hibernate.
* Understanding the Spring Framework transaction abstraction outlines the core classes and describes how to configure and obtain DataSource instances from a variety of sources.
* Synchronizing resources with transactions describes how the application code ensures that resources are created, reused, and cleaned up properly.
* Declarative transaction management describes support for declarative transaction management.
* Programmatic transaction management covers support for programmatic \(that is, explicitly coded\) transaction management.
* Transaction bound event describes how you could use application events within a transaction.

综合事务支持是使用Spring框架最引人注目的原因之一。Spring框架提供了一个一致的抽象的事务管理，它提供了以下好处：
