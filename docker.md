Welcome to the Docs

Docker provides a way to run applications securely isolated in a container, packaged with all its dependencies and libraries. Because your application can always be run with the environment it expects right in the build image, testing and deployment is simpler than ever, as your build will be fully portable and ready to run as designed in any environment. And because containers are lightweight and run without the extra load of a hypervisor, you can run many applications that all rely on different libraries and environments on a single kernel, each one never interfering with the other. This allows you to get more out of your hardware by shifting the “unit of scale” for your application from a virtual or physical machine, to a container instance.

Docker提供了一种方式在容器中安全隔离的来运行应用程序，打包它所有的依赖和类库。因为您的应用程序可以始终运行，正如在构建镜像时所预期的环境下，测试和部署比以往任何时候都更简单，因为您的构建将是完全便携，并准备在任何环境下运行。因为容器是轻量级并且运行时无须额外的虚拟机管理程序负载，您可以在单一的内核上运行许多应用程序依赖于不同的类库和环境，每一个不干扰其他人。这允许您通过将“规模单位”从一个虚拟或物理机器转移到一个容器实例，以获得更多的硬件。
