## 1. Getting Started

### 1.1 Introduction

Kafka is a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log service. It provides the functionality of a messaging system, but with a unique design.

kafka 是一个分布式的，分区的，重复（or复制）的提交日志服务。它使用独特的设计，提供了消息系统的功能。

What does all that mean?

First let's review some basic messaging terminology术语:

* Kafka maintains feeds of messages in categories called _topics_.kafka维护的各种类别的信息源称为主题
* We'll call processes that publish messages to a Kafka topic _producers_.发布消息到一个kafka主题的过程，我们称之为生产者
* We'll call processes that subscribe to topics and process the feed of published messages _consumers_.订阅主题并且处理发布消息的信息源的过程，我们称之为消费者
* Kafka is run as a cluster comprised of one or more servers each of which is called a _broker_.kafka作为一个群集运行时包括一个或多个服务器，每个服务器都被称为代理服务器／掮客／经纪人

So, at a high level, producers send messages over the network to the Kafka cluster which in turn serves them up to consumers like this: 因此，在一个高的水平，生产者把消息通过网络发送到kafka集群，而这反过来又服务于消费者，如下图：

Communication between the clients and the servers is done with a simple, high-performance, language agnostic  不可知论者 [TCP protocol](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html). We provide a Java client for Kafka, but clients are available in [many languages](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients).

**Topics and Logs**

Let's first dive into the high-level abstraction Kafka provides—the topic.

A topic is a category or feed name to which messages are published. For each topic, the Kafka cluster maintains a partitioned log that looks like this:
